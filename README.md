# Speaker Embedding Analysis (Lab Project)

This repository contains code developed as part of a university lab project,
focused on analyzing speaker embeddings using dimensionality reduction
and similarity metrics.

The goal of the project was to visualize and quantify:
- intra-speaker variability
- inter-speaker variability

using cosine distance and t-SNE projections.

### Methods
- Pre-extracted speaker embeddings (x-vectors)
- Cosine similarity and cosine distance
- t-SNE visualization

### Context
This project was completed collaboratively as part of a Master's-level laboratory assignment.
My contribution focused on the analysis pipeline and visualization of embeddings.

The repository is shared here as a code sample demonstrating practical
machine learning and data analysis skills.
